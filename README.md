# FileBlobConverter

*Project offers a clean and concise way to convert files to blobs for databases storage. The project will grant the ability to convert excel, word documents, images, etc into blob files for storage. It will also offer a method for the user convert those blobs back. The blob can be converted back, but if not converted back into it's file type, could cause potential issues.*

*The inspiration of this project is at work we ran into an issue doing this on our client apps. The client needed to grab a excel version of their historical actions in data. This was frustrating to me, because I couldn't find a single project on NPM that could do it.*
